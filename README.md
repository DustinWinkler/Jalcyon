My name is Dustin Winkler and I have been learning web development.

I took a single HTML Course in college back in 2016 and the basic experience stuck with me. It wasn't until the COVID pandemic hit, that I dove deeper into learning web development.
During the pandemic, I have taken the oppurtunity to learn as much as I can. I have been learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby on Rails for the back end. 
I try to learn more every single day; whether I'm working on a project, emulating various front end designs that are appealing, or just reading w3schools, MDN, or various articles.
